# Training Analytics v2 — Module Architecture

Token-safe training analytics endpoints that provide bounded, paginated data for agent consumption. These endpoints prevent agent timeouts by enforcing response size caps.

See `docs/TRAINING_ANALYTICS_API_V2_SPEC.md` for the full specification.

## File Inventory

| File | Endpoints | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `set-facts-generator.js` | — (library) | Core set_facts computation: e1RM, hard set credit, muscle attribution |
| `query-sets.js` | `querySets`, `aggregateSets` | Paginated raw set queries with muscle/exercise filters (v2 onRequest + requireFlexibleAuth) |
| `series-endpoints.js` | `getExerciseSeries`, `getMuscleGroupSeries`, `getMuscleSeries` | Weekly progression series (bounded to 52 weeks) |
| `progress-summary.js` | `getMuscleGroupSummary`, `getMuscleSummary`, `getExerciseSummary` | Comprehensive progress summaries with flags (plateau, deload, overreach) |
| `context-pack.js` | `getCoachingPack`, `getActiveSnapshotLite` | Single-call coaching context (<15KB) and minimal active workout state |
| `active-events.js` | `getActiveEvents` | Paginated workout event stream |
| `get-analysis-summary.js` | `getAnalysisSummary` | Consolidated retrieval of pre-computed training analysis (latest insights, daily brief, weekly review). Supports `sections` filter, `date`, and `limit` params. Called by Shell Agent's `tool_get_training_analysis` via `app/shell/tools.py` |

## Data Model

- **Set facts** (`users/{uid}/set_facts/{id}`): One document per completed set with full attribution
- **Series** (`users/{uid}/analytics_series_exercise/{id}`, `analytics_series_muscle/{id}`): Weekly aggregated progression data
- **Rollups** (`users/{uid}/analytics_rollups/{week}`): Weekly totals

## Response Size Caps

| Endpoint | Max Response |
|----------|-------------|
| `querySets` | 32KB, 200 items |
| `series.*.get` | 10KB, 52 weeks |
| `progress.*.summary` | 15KB |
| `context.coaching.pack` | 15KB |
| `active.snapshotLite` | 2KB |
