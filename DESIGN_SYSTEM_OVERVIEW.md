# 🎨 MYON2 Design System

A comprehensive design system has been implemented to provide consistent visual language, improved developer experience, and better maintainability across the MYON2 iOS application.

## 🚀 Quick Overview

The design system provides:
- **🎨 Consistent Colors**: Brand colors, semantic states, and dark mode support
- **📝 Typography Scale**: iOS-compliant font hierarchy and text styles  
- **📐 Spacing System**: 8-point grid system for predictable layouts
- **🧩 Enhanced Components**: Pre-built, accessible UI components
- **📱 iOS Optimized**: Built specifically for SwiftUI and iOS best practices

## 📁 Location

All design system files are located in:
```
MYON2/MYON2/DesignSystem/
```

## 🛠 Usage

### Basic Example
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: Spacing.md) {
            Text("Welcome to MYON2")
                .headlineLarge()
                .brandText()
            
            DSButton("Get Started", style: .primary) {
                // action
            }
        }
        .screenMargins()
    }
}
```

### Key Components
- **DSButton**: Consistent button styles and states
- **DSCard**: Standardized card containers
- **DSTextField**: Form inputs with validation
- **DSSearchBar**: Enhanced search functionality

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: Complete (Non-intrusive)
- Design system implemented alongside existing code
- No breaking changes to current functionality
- Available for immediate use in new development

### 🔄 Phase 2: Gradual Adoption (Recommended)
1. Use design system for all new views
2. Replace hardcoded colors with design tokens
3. Adopt typography and spacing systems
4. Migrate high-impact existing views

### 🎯 Phase 3: Full Migration (Future)
- Systematic update of all existing components
- Deprecation of legacy styling approaches
- Complete design system adoption
