      <section class="legal-section">
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Povver collects, uses, stores, and shares your personal data when you use the Povver mobile application and website (together, the "Service"). Povver is operated by Valterandersson TMI, a sole proprietorship registered in Finland.</p>
        <p>By creating an account or using the Service, you consent to the practices described in this policy, including the processing of health-related data as described in Section 3.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 1. Data Controller -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>Povver is the data controller for the personal data processed through the Service. This means we determine the purposes and means of processing your data.</p>
        <p>Valterandersson TMI<br>Finland<br>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@povver.ai">privacy@povver.ai</a></p>

      <!-- 2. Data We Collect -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>2. What We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Account Information</h3>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name (if provided), and authentication credentials. Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication or Apple Sign-In — we do not store passwords directly.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Workout and Training Data</h3>
        <p>The core of the Service involves recording your training. This includes exercises performed, sets, repetitions, weights, RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), workout dates, durations, personal notes, templates, routines, and training programs. This data may reveal information about your physical capabilities and health status, and we treat it accordingly (see Section 3).</p>

        <h3>2.3 AI Coaching Data</h3>
        <p>When you interact with the AI coach, we process the messages you send, the responses generated, and the workout context used to produce those responses. Your workout history and performance trends are provided to the AI model so it can generate personalized coaching. See Section 5 for details on how AI processing works.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Device and Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect device type, operating system version, app version, feature usage patterns, interaction events, crash reports, and performance diagnostics. We collect country-level location (not precise GPS coordinates).</p>

        <h3>2.5 Payment Data</h3>
        <p>All subscription payments are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment card details, billing address, or financial information. We receive only a transaction confirmation and subscription status from Apple.</p>

        <h3>2.6 Website Analytics</h3>
        <p>Our website (povver.ai) uses Google Analytics 4 to collect anonymized usage data such as page views, referral sources, and device information. This data is collected via cookies and only with your consent. You can withdraw consent or opt out at any time.</p>

        <h3>2.7 Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not collect biometric identifiers or biometric information (such as fingerprints, facial geometry, voiceprints, or retina scans). We do not collect precise geolocation data. We do not access your device camera, microphone, contacts, or photo library.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. Health-Related Data and Consent -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>3. Health-Related Data and Your Consent</h2>
        <p>Workout data — such as the weights you lift, your training volume, RPE ratings, and performance trends over time — may reveal information about your physical health, fitness level, and physical capabilities. Some privacy laws classify this type of data as health-related or sensitive personal data, subject to heightened protections.</p>
        <p>We take a conservative approach: <strong>we treat your workout and training data as sensitive personal data</strong> and require your explicit consent to process it. When you create an account and begin logging workouts, you are providing this consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account, which will trigger deletion of your personal data (see Section 8).</p>
        <p>Specifically, you consent to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Storage of your workout and training data to provide the Service.</li>
          <li>Processing of your workout data by AI models to generate coaching recommendations and training analysis (see Section 5).</li>
          <li>Use of anonymized, aggregated workout data to improve the Service. This aggregated data cannot identify you.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 4. How We Use Your Data -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing the Service</strong> — storing your workouts, generating AI coaching recommendations, tracking your training progress, and building personalized programs.</li>
          <li><strong>AI Coaching</strong> — your workout history and messages to the AI coach are sent to our AI model provider (Google Vertex AI) to generate responses. See Section 5 for details.</li>
          <li><strong>Service Improvement</strong> — analyzing anonymized usage patterns, identifying bugs, and developing new features. We do not use your individual workout data for this purpose without anonymization.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication</strong> — sending service-related notifications and responding to support requests. We will only send marketing communications with your explicit opt-in consent.</li>
          <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention</strong> — detecting and preventing unauthorized access, abuse, or other harmful activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong> — meeting our obligations under applicable law, including responding to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We do not use your personal data for advertising. We do not share your personal data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. AI Processing -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>5. How AI Processing Works</h2>
        <p>Povver uses AI to provide coaching, post-workout analysis, and program generation. <strong>The AI coach is an automated system, not a human.</strong> When you send messages to the AI coach, those messages are transmitted to a third-party AI infrastructure provider for processing. By using the AI coaching features, you acknowledge and consent to this transmission.</p>
        <p>Here is exactly what happens with your data during AI processing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI Model Provider:</strong> We use <strong>Google Vertex AI</strong> (operated by Google LLC) to run large language models that power the coaching features.</li>
          <li><strong>What is sent:</strong> When you interact with the AI coach or when a post-workout analysis is generated, relevant portions of your workout history, the current conversation context, and your training patterns are transmitted to Google Vertex AI for processing.</li>
          <li><strong>How it is processed:</strong> Google Vertex AI processes this data to generate a response (coaching advice, workout analysis, or a training program). The processing happens on Google's infrastructure. No human reviews your individual conversations.</li>
          <li><strong>Data retention by the AI provider:</strong> Under our agreement with Google, data sent to Vertex AI for inference is not used by Google to train or improve their models. Google's data processing terms apply to this processing.</li>
          <li><strong>No third-party model training:</strong> Your personal workout data is never used to train AI models — not by us, and not by our AI provider.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 6. Third-Party Data Processors -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>6. Third-Party Data Processors</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the Service. Each processes data on our behalf, under data processing agreements, and subject to their own privacy policies:</p>

              <li>Firebase Authentication — account creation and sign-in</li>

              <li>Google Analytics 4 — anonymized website usage analytics</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Apple Inc.</strong> (United States)
            <ul>
              <li>Sign in with Apple — authentication</li>
              <li>App Store — payment processing and subscription management</li>
              <li>Crash reporting — application stability diagnostics</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may integrate additional service providers in the future. When we do, we will update this policy and notify you of material changes. Any new provider will be bound by a data processing agreement before receiving access to personal data.</p>

      <!-- 7. International Data Transfers -->
      <section class="legal-section">

        <p>Povver is based in Finland (EU). Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside the European Economic Area, including the United States, where our third-party service providers maintain infrastructure.</p>
        <p>These transfers are protected by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (for transfers to certified U.S. organizations)</li>
          <li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission</li>
          <li>The UK International Data Transfer Agreement (UK IDTA) for transfers from the United Kingdom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We ensure that any international transfer of your data is accompanied by appropriate safeguards that provide a level of protection equivalent to that available within the EEA.</p>
