      <section class="legal-section">
        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Povver mobile application and related services (the "Service") operated by Valterandersson TMI ("Povver," "we," "us," or "our"), a sole proprietorship registered in Finland.</p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Povver is a strength training app that provides workout tracking, AI-powered coaching, training analysis, and program generation. The Service is available on iOS.</p>
        <p>The AI coaching features provide general fitness guidance based on your workout data. <strong>Povver is not a medical service.</strong> The recommendations provided by the AI coach are not medical advice and should not be treated as such. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting or modifying any exercise program, especially if you have health conditions or injuries.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian. By using the Service, you represent that you meet these requirements.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate information when creating your account.</li>
