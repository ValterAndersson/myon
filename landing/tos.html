        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Povver mobile application and related services (the "Service") operated by Valterandersson TMI ("Povver," "we," "us," or "our"), a sole proprietorship registered in Finland.</p>
        <p>By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

      <!-- 1. The Service -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Povver is a strength training application that provides workout tracking, AI-powered coaching, training analysis, and program generation. The Service is available on iOS.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- 2. Health and Safety -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>2. Health and Safety</h2>
        <p><strong>This section is important. Please read it carefully.</strong></p>
        <p>Povver is a fitness tracking and coaching tool. It is <strong>not a medical device, medical service, or healthcare provider</strong>. The AI-generated coaching, workout recommendations, and training analysis provided by the Service are for informational and general fitness guidance purposes only.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not medical advice.</strong> Nothing in the Service constitutes medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. AI-generated recommendations are based on your workout data and general fitness principles — they do not account for medical conditions, injuries, physical limitations, medications, or other health factors that a qualified professional would consider.</li>
          <li><strong>Consult a professional.</strong> You should consult a qualified healthcare professional, physician, or certified personal trainer before beginning, modifying, or intensifying any exercise program. This is especially important if you have pre-existing health conditions, injuries, are pregnant, or have not exercised recently.</li>
          <li><strong>You assume the risk.</strong> Strength training involves inherent physical risks, including but not limited to muscle strains, joint injuries, cardiovascular events, and other physical harm. You are solely responsible for evaluating whether any exercise, weight, or recommendation is appropriate for your body, fitness level, and health status. You voluntarily assume all risks associated with your use of the Service and any exercises performed based on information provided by the Service.</li>
          <li><strong>AI limitations.</strong> The AI coach may produce recommendations that are inaccurate, inappropriate for your circumstances, or based on incomplete data. It cannot observe your form, detect pain, or assess your physical condition. Never continue an exercise if you experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort, regardless of what the AI recommends.</li>
          <li><strong>No guaranteed outcomes.</strong> We do not guarantee any specific fitness, strength, body composition, or health outcome from using the Service.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. Eligibility -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. If we learn that a user is under 18, we will terminate their account and delete their data.</p>

      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>4. Your Account</h2>

          <li>Provide accurate information when creating your account.</li>
          <li>Keep your login credentials secure and not share them with others.</li>
          <li>Not create multiple accounts for the same person.</li>

        <p>Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store. By subscribing, you agree to Apple's payment terms. Subscription fees are charged in advance on a recurring basis (monthly or annually, depending on your selected plan).</p>

        <h3>5.3 Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Subscriptions auto-renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain access to premium features until then.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refund requests are handled by Apple in accordance with their refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

        <h3>5.5 Price Changes</h3>
        <p>We may change subscription prices. Apple will notify you of price changes, and you will have the opportunity to accept or decline before the new price takes effect. If you do not accept a price change, your subscription will not renew at the end of the current billing period.</p>

        <h3>5.6 Auto-Renewal Disclosure</h3>
        <p>YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH BILLING PERIOD AT THE THEN-CURRENT PRICE UNLESS YOU CANCEL AT LEAST 24 HOURS BEFORE THE END OF THE CURRENT PERIOD. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings (Settings &gt; [your name] &gt; Subscriptions). Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.</p>

        <h3>5.7 EU Right of Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>If you are a consumer in the EU or EEA, you have a 14-day right to withdraw from a digital content purchase. However, by starting to use the premium features of the Service after subscribing, you expressly consent to the immediate performance of the contract and acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal once the digital content has been fully provided during the withdrawal period. Apple manages the withdrawal and refund process for App Store purchases.</p>

      <!-- 8. AI Features -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>8. AI Features</h2>
        <p>The Service includes AI-powered features such as post-workout analysis, coaching conversations, and program generation. <strong>The AI coach is an automated system — it is not a human.</strong> These features are powered by large language models operated by Google (Vertex AI). You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-generated content is produced by machine learning models. It may contain inaccuracies, errors, or recommendations that are unsuitable for your specific situation.</li>
          <li>AI recommendations are not a substitute for professional coaching, personal training, medical advice, or physical therapy.</li>
          <li>You are solely responsible for evaluating whether any AI-generated recommendation is appropriate for your fitness level, health status, and personal circumstances before acting on it.</li>
          <li>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, safety, or suitability of any AI-generated content.</li>
          <li>AI features may be modified, improved, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.</li>
          <li>When you send messages to the AI coach, those messages — along with relevant workout data — are transmitted to Google Vertex AI (a third-party service) for processing. No human reads your individual conversations. By using the AI coaching features, you consent to this transmission and processing.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 9. Beta and Experimental Features -->

        <h2>9. Beta and Experimental Features</h2>
        <p>We may offer features labeled as "beta," "experimental," "preview," or similar designations. These features are provided as-is, may be unstable, and may be modified or removed without notice. By using beta features, you acknowledge the additional risks and agree that we bear no additional liability for issues arising from their use.</p>

      <!-- 14. Dispute Resolution -->
      <section class="legal-section">
        <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>

        <h3>14.1 Mandatory Pre-Suit Notice and Cure Period</h3>
        <p>Before initiating any formal legal proceeding or arbitration, you must first send a written notice of your dispute to <a href="mailto:legal@povver.ai">legal@povver.ai</a> (a "Notice of Dispute"). The Notice must include: (a) your name and account email, (b) a detailed description of the dispute, (c) the specific relief you seek, and (d) your signature (electronic signature is acceptable). We will have 60 days from receipt of the Notice to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. You agree not to initiate any proceeding during this 60-day period. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days, either party may proceed as described below.</p>

        <h3>14.2 Users in the European Union, EEA, and United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>If you are a consumer resident in the EU, EEA, or United Kingdom, these Terms are governed by the laws of Finland. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Finland. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence.</p>
        <p>You also have the right to submit disputes to the Online Dispute Resolution platform provided by the European Commission at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.</p>

        <h3>14.3 Users Outside the European Union, EEA, and United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>If you are located outside the EU, EEA, and United Kingdom, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) under its then-current arbitration rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in English, seated in Helsinki, Finland, by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</p>
        <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</strong> YOU AND POVVER AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. You agree to waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against Povver.</p>
        <p><strong>JURY TRIAL WAIVER:</strong> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND POVVER WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>

        <h3>14.4 Small Claims Court</h3>
        <p>Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court in their jurisdiction instead of arbitration, provided the claim falls within the court's jurisdictional limits. If the claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, it shall be subject to arbitration as described above.</p>

        <h3>14.5 Prevailing Party Fees</h3>
        <p>In any arbitration or legal proceeding arising from these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses from the non-prevailing party, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

        <h3>14.6 Limitation Period</h3>
        <p>ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CLAIM AROSE, OR IT IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. This limitation period applies to all claims regardless of legal theory (contract, tort, statute, or otherwise). This provision does not apply where a shorter or longer limitation period is mandated by applicable law that cannot be contractually modified.</p>
