      <div class="container feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-content">
          <h2 class="feature-title">Stop Wondering If You Should Add Weight</h2>
          <p class="feature-copy">You finished a solid bench session. Was it enough to move up next week? With a notebook, you'd never know. With a tracking app, you'd scroll through old entries and try to spot a trend yourself. Povver reviews every session automatically — compares your performance across weeks, flags lifts where you've stalled, and tells you exactly when you're ready to progress.</p>
          <p class="feature-copy">Progressive overload is how you get stronger. But tracking it manually across dozens of exercises and muscle groups is a full-time job. Povver does it for you, so you can focus on lifting.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="container feature-grid feature-grid--reverse">
        <div class="feature-content">
          <h2 class="feature-title">Programming Is a Second Job. Outsource It.</h2>
          <p class="feature-copy">Researching exercises, balancing volume across muscle groups, picking the right progression scheme — it's hours of work before you even touch a barbell. Tell Povver what you want in plain language. "Build me a 4-day upper/lower split" or "I need a quick leg day, dumbbells only." You get a complete program with exercises, sets, and target weights pulled from your actual training history — not a generic template.</p>
          <p class="feature-copy">Mid-workout, the coach stays useful without getting in the way. The squat rack is taken? Ask for a swap. Can't remember your last bench numbers? Ask. It keeps answers short because you're resting between sets, not reading an article.</p>

        <div class="feature-content">
          <h2 class="feature-title">Log a Set in Two Seconds. Get Back to Lifting.</h2>
          <p class="feature-copy">Most tracking apps make you tap through three screens to log one set. By the time you're done, your rest timer is up and you've lost focus. Povver lays every set out in a single grid — tap a cell, change the number, move on. Weight, reps, and effort for every set, editable in any order.</p>
          <p class="feature-copy">Big buttons you can hit with chalky hands. Fast number entry. Nothing between you and your next set. If you've ever wished you could just scribble in a notebook but still have the data tracked — that's what this feels like.</p>

        <div class="feature-content">
          <h2 class="feature-title">Your Workout. Your Rules.</h2>
          <p class="feature-copy">Some days you follow a program. Some days you walk into the gym and figure it out. Most apps punish the second kind of session — they want you to pick a plan and stick to it. Povver works either way. Start empty and add exercises as you go. Pick a saved template. Follow your routine's next session. Or just ask the coach to build something on the spot.</p>
          <p class="feature-copy">Add exercises, remove them, drag to reorder — mid-workout, nothing is locked down. The app fits how you actually train, not the other way around.</p>
