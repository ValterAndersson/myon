Here are chest exercises for different experience levels:

### Beginner

*   **Push Up**: A bodyweight exercise that enhances upper body strength and core stability. It targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
*   **Dumbbell Press**: This exercise builds upper body strength and muscle mass. Dumbbells allow for a greater range of motion and stability.
*   **Flat Dumbbell Press**: A compound exercise to build upper body pushing strength, targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps.
*   **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Builds chest, shoulder, and triceps strength. Dumbbells help correct strength imbalances.

### Advanced

*   **Muscle Up**: A highly advanced bodyweight exercise combining a pull-up and a dip. It builds significant upper body strength, coordination, and power.

Would you like me to create a workout template with any of these?

{"parts":[{"text":"Here are chest exercises for different experience levels:\n\n### Beginner\n\n*   **Push Up**: A bodyweight exercise that enhances upper body strength and core stability. It targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n*   **Dumbbell Press**: This exercise builds upper body strength and muscle mass. Dumbbells allow for a greater range of motion and stability.\n*   **Flat Dumbbell Press**: A compound exercise to build upper body pushing strength, targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n*   **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Builds chest, shoulder, and triceps strength. Dumbbells help correct strength imbalances.\n\n### Advanced\n\n*   **Muscle Up**: A highly advanced bodyweight exercise combining a pull-up and a dip. It builds significant upper body strength, coordination, and power.\n\nWould you like me to create a workout template with any of these?"}],"role":"model"}

It targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n*   **Dumbbell Press**: This exercise builds upper body strength and muscle mass. Dumbbells allow for a greater range of motion and stability.\n*   **Flat Dumbbell Press**: A compound exercise to build upper body pushing strength, targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n*   **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Builds chest, shoulder, and triceps strength. Dumbbells help correct strength imbalances.\n\n### Advanced\n\n*   **Muscle Up**: A highly advanced bodyweight exercise combining a pull-up and a dip. It builds significant upper body strength, coordination, and power.\n\nWould you like me to create a workout template with any of these?"}],"role":"model"}
