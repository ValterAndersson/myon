Catalog Curation Pipeline Report:

**Execution Summary:**

*   **Exercises Processed:** A batch of 9 exercises was fetched and processed.
*   **Approvals:** 4 exercises were reviewed and approved.
*   **Data Refinements:** 5 exercises underwent metadata correction for clarity and accuracy.
*   **Alias Management:** Alias suggestions were checked for all newly approved exercises.

**Detailed Actions:**

*   **Approved Exercises (4):**
    *   Back Extension
    *   Ball Side Throw
    *   Ball Slams
    *   Bent Over Lateral Raise

*   **Refined & Corrected Exercises (5):**
    *   Renamed 'Bayesian Curl' to 'Dumbbell Bicep Curl' to match its profile.
    *   Corrected 'Bench Press' which had a description for a 'Bodyweight Squat'. It was updated to 'Barbell Bench Press' with accurate metadata.
    *   Renamed 'Bent Over One Arm Row' to 'Dumbbell Bent Over One Arm Row' for specificity.
    *   Renamed 'Bicep Curl' to 'Cable Bicep Curl' to specify equipment.
    *   An existing 'Barbell Shoulder Shrug' was already approved and required no action.

**Follow-up Items:**

*   **Pending Approvals:** The 5 refined exercises are still in 'draft' status and need to be run through the pipeline again for final approval.
*   **Data Integrity:** The significant error found in the 'Barbell Bench Press' record suggests a potential for other similar data mismatches in the catalog. A broader audit may be warranted.
