Shell Tools - Tool definitions for ShellAgent using pure skills.

CRITICAL: This module imports ONLY from app/skills/.
NO imports from app/agents/ (coach_agent.py, planner_agent.py).

Tool categories:
- Read tools: From coach_skills.py (analytics, user data)
- Write tools: From planner_skills.py (direct execution, cards have accept/dismiss buttons)

Security:
- Tool signatures do NOT include user_id (prevents LLM hallucination)
- user_id is retrieved from contextvars (set in agent_engine_app.py)
- Thread-safe for concurrent requests in Agent Engine

The tools defined here wrap skill functions with ADK-compatible signatures.
